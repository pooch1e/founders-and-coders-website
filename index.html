            </div>
            <p>
              I became interested in coding through university when I was
              studying fine art. One of my peers made an insane work that was an
              interactive television connected to a kinect, that melted your
              body into pixels when you stood in front of it (using processing).
              Since then, I've tried many times (and failed lots too) to pick up
              the skills, however, it has never super duper stuck. Everytime I
              try, I do learn a little bit more!
            </p>
            <p>I wanna do x</p>
            <p>
              Most of all, I do have a massive interest in the ethics behind
              tech. I think we have a responsiblity as practitioners to make
              considered and ethical choices about how we are using, creating
              and disseminating technology. The big watch word at the moment is
              AI. I'm super concerned that the bulk of research in this area is
              being driven by profit-driven corporations, which I do not think
              is a net positive for the world. I want to be able to understand
              how AI and software development works so I can better educate and
              support my peers and community in the future.

                Hi... I'm Joel and I really really really want to be a software
                developer. While I'm still figuring out what I'm doing, I
                definitely know what I like doing! I'm a creative person and
                above all, I love learning!!!

                I've messed around with doing LOADS of different things - like
                making music, visuals for club gigs, short films, photography
                and design. I love my hobbies and I seem to cycle through em- if
                it isn't playing guitar, it's playing board games, RPG's,
                writing stories, birdwatching, cooking, reading, dancing or just
                watching a movie!! My obsession at the moment is to try and make
                cool glitchy visuals with p5.js
